# N-BEATS Lightning


N-BEATS, Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time Series, is a neural network based model for univariate time series forecasting. The N-BEATS implementation in this repository is based on the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10437.pdf.).  This model is designed to be easy to use and extend, and so you can apply N-BEATS to your own time series data and explore its capabilities.

The code in this repository provides an implementation of N-BEATS in [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/). PyTorch Lightning is a lightweight PyTorch wrapper for high-performance AI research. It provides a high-level interface for PyTorch that makes it easier to train models, while still giving you the flexibility to customize your training loop. 


## N-BEATS Algorithm

N-BEATS, Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time Series, is a neural network based model for univariate time series forecasting. It was proposed by Boris N. Oreshkin and his co-authors at Element AI in 2019. N-BEATS consists of a deep stack of fully connected layers with backward and forward residual connections. The model can learn a set of basis functions that can decompose any time series into interpretable components, such as trend and seasonality. N-BEATS can also handle a wide range of forecasting problems without requiring any domain-specific modifications or feature engineering. N-BEATS has achieved state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, such as M3, M4, and TOURISM. This repository provides an implementation of N-BEATS in PyTorch Lightning, along with the code to reproduce the experimental results using the M4 dataset which is included as a reference in this repository. 

Here are some key points about the N-BEATS algorithm:

- **Block Architecture**:
  N-BEATS consists of a stack of fully connected neural networks called "blocks." Each block processes the input time series data and outputs a set of forecasts along with a backcast, which is the reconstructed version of the input.

- **Generic and Interpretable Blocks**:
  There are two types of blocks within N-BEATS: Generic and Interpretable. Generic blocks are designed to learn the underlying patterns in the data automatically, while Interpretable blocks incorporate prior knowledge about the data and are structured to provide insights into the learned patterns.

- **Stacked Ensemble**:
  The blocks are stacked together in an ensemble, and their forecasts are combined to produce the final prediction. This ensemble approach allows N-BEATS to handle a wide range of time series forecasting problems effectively.

- **Parameter Sharing and Scalability**:
  N-BEATS is designed with parameter sharing across the blocks, which promotes scalability and efficiency in training and inference.

- **Performance**:
  N-BEATS has shown state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmark time series forecasting datasets, making it a robust choice for many forecasting applications.

- **Fast Learning**:
  N-BEATS is a fast learner, and it can be trained in a few epochs on a single GPU. This makes it easy to experiment with different hyperparameters and architectures. It generally settles quickly into a relative minimum, and overtraining typically hurts the model's performance. Since many models can be trained quickly, it is easy to build an ensemble of models to improve performance and generalization.


The N-BEATS algorithm is a powerful tool for time series forecasting, providing a blend of automatic learning, interpretability, and robust performance across different domains.


## Getting Started

### Installation

This N-BEATS implementation by downloading the source from the [github  repository](https://github.com/realdanielbyrne/N-BEATS-Lightning) or installing it as a pip package using the following command:

```bash
  pip install lightningnbeats
```

### Simple Example
The following is a simple example of how to use this model. 

#### Load Data
First load the required libraries and your data.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from lightningnbeats import NBeatsNet
from lightningnbeats.loaders import *
import pandas as pd

# Load the milk.csv dataset
milk = pd.read_csv('src/data/milk.csv', index_col=0)
milkval = milk.values.flatten() # flat numpy array
milk.head()
```

#### Define the model and its hyperparameters

Define the model  by defining the architecture in the `stack_types` parameter.  The `stack_types` parameter is a list of strings that specify the type of block to use in each stack.  The following block types are available:

- Generic
- GenericAE
- GenericAEBackcast
- GenericAEBackcastAE
- Trend
- TrendAE
- Seasonality
- SeasonalityAE
- AutoEncoder
- AutoEncoderAE
- HaarWavelet
- DB2Wavelet
- DB2AltWavelet
- DB3Wavelet
- DB3AltWavelet
- DB4Wavelet
- DB4AltWavelet
- DB10Wavelet
- DB10AltWavelet
- DB20Wavelet
- DB20AltWavelet
- Coif1Wavelet
- Coif1AltWavelet
- Coif2Wavelet
- Coif2AltWavelet
- Coif3Wavelet
- Coif10Wavelet 
- Symlet2Wavelet
- Symlet2AltWavelet
- Symlet3Wavelet  
- Symlet10Wavelet
- Symlet20Wavelet   

This implementation extends the original paper by allowing any combination blocks in any order simply by specifying the block types in the stack_types parameter.  


```python
forecast_length = 6
backcast_length = 4 * forecast_length
batch_size = 64
n_stacks = 6

interpretable_milkmodel = NBeatsNet(
  stack_types=['Trend', 'Seasonality'],
  backcast_length = backcast_length,
  forecast_length = forecast_length, 
  n_blocks_per_stack = 3,
  thetas_dim = 5,    
  t_width=256,  
  s_width=2048,
  share_weights = True
)
```

This model will forecast 6 steps into the future. The common practice is to use a multiple of the forecast horizon for the backcast length.  In this case, we will use 4 times the forecast horizon. 

Larger batch sizes will result in faster training, but may require more memory.  The number of blocks per stack is a hyperparameter that can be tuned.  The share_weights parameter is set to True to share weights across the blocks. 

#### Define a Pytorch Lightning DataModule

Instantiate one of the predefined PyTorch Lightning Time Series Data Modules to help organize and load your data.

- *TimeSeriesDataModule* - A PyTorch Lightning DataModule that takes a univariate time series as input and returns batches of samples of the time series. This is the most basic DataModule and is useful for single univariate time series data.
- *RowCollectionTimeSeriesDataModule* - A PyTorch Lightning DataModule accepts a dataset that is a collection of time series organized into rows where each row represents a time series, and each column represents subsequent observations. For instance this is how the M4 dataset is organized.
- *ColumnarCollectionTimeSeriesDataModule* - A PyTorch Datamodule that takes a collection of time series as input and returns batches of samples. The input dataset is a collection of time series organized such that columns represent individual time series and rows represent subsequent observations. This is how the Tourism dataset is organized.


#### Define a Pytorch Lightning ModelCheckpoint (optional)

Define a Pytorch Ligntning ModelCheckpoint callback to save the best model during training.  The model will be saved to the default  `lightning/logs` directory unless otherwise specified.  The `save_top_k` parameter will save the top 3 models based on validation loss.  The `monitor` parameter specifies the metric to monitor for saving the best model.  Here we specify validation loss.  The `mode` parameter specifies whether to minimize or maximize the metric.  The `save_last` parameter will save the last model trained.

```python
i_chk_callback = ModelCheckpoint(
  save_top_k = 2, # save top 2 models
  monitor = "val_loss", # monitor validation loss as evaluation 
  mode = "min",
  filename = "{name}-{epoch:02d}-{val_loss:.2f}",
)

# Define a tensorboard logger
i_tb_logger = pl_loggers.TensorBoardLogger(save_dir="lightning_logs/", name=i_name)

```

#### Define a Pytorch Lightning Trainer and train the model

```python

interpretable_trainer =  pl.Trainer(
  accelerator='auto' # use GPU if available
  ,max_epochs=200
  ,callbacks=[i_chk_callback]  
  ,logger=[i_tb_logger]
)

interpretable_trainer.fit(interpretable_milkmodel, datamodule=dm)
interpretable_trainer.validate(interpretable_milkmodel, datamodule=dm) 
```

#### Using CUDA GPU for Training

If you have a CUDA capable GPU, you will want to install the [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) and the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) version that works with the toolkit. Installing these pacakged will allow you to train your model on the GPU.  You can check if you have a CUDA capable GPU by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
  $ nvidia-smi
```

or in python environment

```python
  import torch
  torch.cuda.is_available()
```

## N-BEATS Extensions and Variations

This repository provides an implementation of N-BEATS in PyTorch Lightning based on the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10437.pdf). However, the implementation in this repository has been extended to include extended features which can be used to augment the basic design with more advanced features.

### ActiveG

This parameter when enabled applies the model's activation funtion to the linear funtions (gb and gf) which are found by the network in the last layer of each block using the functions' parameters found in the preceding layer. The parameter `active_g` is not a feature found in the original N-Beats paper.

You can enable this feature by setting `active_g` to `True`.  Enabling this activation function helps the Generic model converge.  Generally this results in a comparably accurate model in fewer training cycles.  

Also, Generic models as defined in the original paper have a tendency to not converge.  This is likely due to the sucessive linear layers without activation functions in the final two layers of each Generic block. The fix or this would typically be to retrain, or add or remove a stack or layer. However, enabling this parameter usualy fixes the problem without the need to modify any parameters or to adjust the chosen architecture.

The intuition behind the inclusion of this parameter is that the generic model as originally designed connects two layers of Linear fully conencted nodes, the first is ostensibly designed to find the parameters of an expansion polynomial function and the second to find the functions that best fit the forecast and backcast outputs of the block. However, linear layers without activations are not able to learn non-linear functions.  This parameter allows the model to learn non-linear functions by applying the activation function to the linear functions found by the model in the last layer of each block.  This is concsistent with the interpretable arcitecture since the basis functions in the Trend, Seasonality, and (in this version) the Wavlet blocks are  non-linear functions, and so this feature modifies the Generic model to be more similar in structure to the basis function blocks.


### Wavelet Basis Expansion Blocks

This repository constains a number of experimental Wavelet Basis Expansion Blocks. Wavelet basis expansion is a mathematical technique used to represent signals or functions in terms of simpler, fixed building blocks called wavelets. Unlike Fourier transforms, which use sine and cosine functions as basis elements, wavelets can be localized in both time and frequency. This means they can represent both the frequency content of a signal and when these frequencies occur. This method is particularly useful for analyzing functions or signals that contain features at multiple scales.  Wavelet basis expansion can be extremely useful in analyzing time series data for the very reason that time series often contain information at multiple scales. The multi-resolution analysis capability of wavelets is particularly suited to capturing the essence of time series data, which can have complex, hierarchical structures due to the presence of trends, seasonal effects, cycles, and irregular fluctuations. 

Wavelet blocks can be used in isolation or in combination with other blocks freely. For instance

```python
n_stacks = 5
stack_types = ['DB3Wavelet'] * n_stacks # 5 stacks of DB3Wavelet blocks
stack_types = ['Trend','DB3Wavelet'] * n_stacks # 5 stacks of 1 Trend and 1 DB3Wavelet block
stack_types = ['DB3Wavelet','Generic'] # 1 DB3Wavelet block followed by 1 Generic block
```

The Wavelet blocks avaiavlable in this repository are as follows:

- HaarWavelet
- DB2Wavelet
- DB2AltWavelet
- DB3Wavelet
- DB3AltWavelet
- DB4Wavelet
- DB4AltWavelet
- DB10Wavelet
- DB10AltWavelet
- DB20Wavelet
- DB20AltWavelet
- Coif1Wavelet
- Coif1AltWavelet
- Coif2Wavelet
- Coif2AltWavelet
- Coif3Wavelet
- Coif10Wavelet 
- Symlet2Wavelet
- Symlet2AltWavelet
- Symlet3Wavelet  
- Symlet10Wavelet
- Symlet20Wavelet 

### AutoEncoder Block

The AutoEncoder Block utilizes an AutoEncoider structure in both the forecast and backcast branches in the N-BEATS architecture.  The AutoEncoder block is useful for noisey time series data like Electric generation or in highly varied datasets like the M4.   Ir struggles with simpler more predictable datasets like the Milk Production Dataset.

Like any other blocks in this implementation, the AutoEncoder block can be used in isolation or in combination with other blocks freely. For instance

```python 
n_stacks = 5
stack_types = ['AutoEncoder'] * n_stacks # 5 stacks of AutoEncoder blocks 
stack_types = ['Trend','AutoEncoder'] * n_stacks # 5 stacks of 1 Trend block followed by 1 AutoEncoder block
```

### GenericAEBackcast

The GenericAEBackcast block is a generic block that uses an AutoEncoder structure in the backcast branch of the N-BEATS architecture.  This block is useful for noisey time series data like Electric generation or in highly varied datasets like the M4.   It doesn't struggle like the AutoEncoder block does with simpler more predictable datasets like the Milk Production Dataset, and is genreally more accurate than the AutoEncoder block, and it settles on a solution faster.  The block could be beneficial in an ensenble of models.


```python 
n_stacks = 5
stack_types = ['GenericAEBackcast'] * n_stacks # 5 stacks of GenericAEBackcast blocks 
```

### AERootBlock and its Variations

The base N-Beats model consists of a stack of fully connected layers at the head of every block before the spilt into backcast and forecast branches.The AERootBlock is a variation of the root block that uses an AutoEncoder structure as opposed to a uniform stack of fully connected layers.  The AERootBlock is useful for noisey time series data like Electric generation or in highly varied datasets like the M4. 

The AERootblock is the parent class of the following blocks:

- GenericAE
- GenericAEBackcastAE
- TrendAE
- SeasonalityAE
- AutoEncoderAE

Like all other block types, the AERootBlock can be used in isolation or in combination with other blocks.

```python
n_stacks = 5
stack_types = ['GenericAE'] * n_stacks # 5 stacks of GenericAE blocks
stack_types = ['TrendAE','GenericAE'] * n_stacks # 5 stacks of 1 TrendAE and 1 GenericAE block
```

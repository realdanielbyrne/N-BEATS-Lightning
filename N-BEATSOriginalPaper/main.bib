  title={On the categorization of demand patterns},
  author={Syntetos, A. A. and Boylan, J. E. and Croston, J. D.},
  journal={Journal of the Operational Research Society},
  volume={56},
  number={5},
  pages={495--503},
  year={2005},
  abstract={
    The categorization of alternative demand patterns facilitates the selection
    of a forecasting method and it is an essential element of many inventory
    control software packages. The common practice in the inventory control
    software industry is to arbitrarily categorize those demand patterns and
    then proceed to select an estimation procedure and optimize the forecast
    parameters. Alternatively, forecasting methods can be directly compared,
    based on some theoretically quantified error measure, for the purpose of
    establishing regions of superior performance and then define the demand
    patterns based on the results. It is this approach that is discussed in
    this paper and its application is demonstrated by considering EWMA,
    Croston's method and an alternative to Croston's estimator developed by the
    first two authors of this paper. Comparison results are based on a
    theoretical analysis of the mean square error due to its mathematically
    tractable nature. The categorization rules proposed are expressed in terms
    of the average inter-demand interval and the squared coefficient of
    variation of demand sizes. The validity of the results is tested on 3000
    real-intermittent demand data series coming from the automotive industry.}
